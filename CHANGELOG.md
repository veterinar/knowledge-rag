### Unreleased

- **fix(runtime)** — versioned mode now verifies the declared `models.embedding.runtime_version`, `dimensions`, and `pooling` against the installed FastEmbed registry (registry-only lookup: `EMBEDDINGS_REGISTRY` iteration, no model construction, download, or network). Versioned mode admits exactly three models — `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` (384, `cls-or-prepooled`), `BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5` (1024, `cls-or-prepooled`), both via the exact `OnnxTextEmbedding` class, and `intfloat/multilingual-e5-large` (1024, `mean`) via the exact `PooledEmbedding` class; every other model/class (including PooledNormalized and Custom) fails closed, as do duplicate registrations, non-canonical spellings, registry dimension drift, missing CPU `fastembed` metadata, and a shadowing `fastembed-gpu` distribution. `cls-or-prepooled` is the exact FastEmbed 0.8.0 branch contract, not a per-artifact claim. A mismatch no longer aborts startup: `Config()` construction survives, the server degrades to stats-only (`restart_required_environment_changed`, retrieval blocked, no raw exception text), and `generation_compatibility()` re-verifies freshly on every call (offline generation still hard-fails via the typed `EmbeddingRuntimeContractError`). Generations sealed with the older generic `cls` pooling value must be rebuilt offline.
- **fix(server)** — `main()` passes `config.watch_debounce_seconds` to `DocumentWatcher` directly; the `getattr` fallback and extra `float()` coercion are removed. `config.yaml` is the sole owner of the watcher default/validation.
- **fix(server)** — versioned MCP startup now exposes a strictly read-only tool surface, preserves safe stats-only diagnostics when generation pinning fails, and blocks other retrieval-status reads before orchestrator construction.
- **fix(retrieval)** — versioned Chroma serving now attaches the pinned FastEmbed embedding function, preventing semantic text queries from falling back to Chroma's default model/cache under no-egress runtime policy.
- **docs(scoring)** — public scoring contract clarified, no behavior change: search results document the unrounded effective `raw_score`, `query_relative_score` (0.0-1.0, min-max normalized within the single query's returned cohort; legacy `score` is its alias), `score_source`, and the additive `filtered_by_query_relative_score` envelope counter. `min_score` is documented as filtering `query_relative_score` only — query-relative, not comparable across queries, no universal cut-off (removes the stale "0.2-0.4" recommendation) in docs/API.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, and the five skill guides (rag-check-first, rag-web-fallback, rag-troubleshoot, rag-deep-dive, rag-security-first) that hard-coded universal `min_score` cut-offs and absolute `score` bands. `evaluate_retrieval` is documented as an `offline_smoke` expected-document reachability check returning MRR@5/Recall@5 diagnostics only — never a benchmark or quality measurement; the unsupported Precision@5 claim, wrong test-case schema (`expected_docs` → `expected_filepath`), and universal MRR thresholds are removed from docs/API.md, README.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, the tool docstrings, and the rewritten `rag-evaluate-quality` skill (with its README.md / skills/CATALOG.md labels).

### v4.9.1 (2026-08-15) — Physically read-only versioned serving

- **fix(runtime)** — ChromaDB's writable `PersistentClient` now opens only a receipt-verified, process-local temporary copy. The published generation remains physically write-denied and content-bound; FTS stays on its sealed SQLite `mode=ro` artifact.
- **fix(diagnostics)** — versioned startup preserves the safe backend/environment mismatch detail inside the stable `get_index_stats` envelope.

### v4.9.0 (2026-08-15) — Release/runtime reproducibility: canonical `requirements.lock` installs + dependency parity

**`requirements.lock` (pip-compile `--generate-hashes`) is now the canonical production install input.** Docker, CI, and the release workflow all install identically: `pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.lock`, then the package wheel with `--no-deps`, then `pip check`. The runtime always imports installed package bytes — the Docker image no longer copies the source tree over `/app`.

**Added:**

- **feat(repro)** — dependency parity enforcement in `mcp_server.generations`: `lock_pin_map` (canonical normalized name → exact version + sha256 hashes; malformed lines and normalized duplicates fail closed), `require_self_version_parity` (installed `knowledge-rag` version must equal `mcp_server.__version__` — the self package is not in the pip-compile lock), and `verify_runtime_dependency_parity` (every active default `Requires-Dist` dependency pinned; every installed lock pin at the exact locked version; optional marker-inactive pins exempt). Enforced at generation build (`generation_identity`) and at the runtime drift recheck (`_retrieval_environment_digests`). Installed RECORD digest and lock digest remain distinct evidence.
- **feat(config)** — typed `advanced.watch_for_changes` (default `true`) and `advanced.watch_debounce_seconds` (default `10.0`, must be finite positive; invalid values fall back with a WARN). The watcher construction in `server.py` uses them instead of the hardcoded `debounce_seconds=10.0`. Versioned mode still forcibly disables the watcher; `KNOWLEDGE_RAG_WATCHER_DISABLED=1` remains the emergency override.
- **ci(release)** — release workflow: new `verify-versions` job asserting tag == `pyproject.toml` == `mcp_server/__init__.py` == `npm/package.json`; clean-runtime pre-release tests (fresh venv, lock + wheel `--no-deps` + `pip check` + self-version parity import); release verification receipt recording wheel SHA-256, sorted archive manifest, embedded-lock presence + lock digest, and build profile — kept deliberately distinct from generation receipts, which never record a wheel SHA.
- **deps** — `requirements.txt` aligned with project metadata: unused `rank-bm25` removed (dead since the v4.2.0 inverted-index BM25), direct `numpy` retained. `requirements.lock` is untouched and authoritative.

**Packaging:** wheel now force-includes all five presets (multilingual.yaml added) alongside `config.example.yaml` and `requirements.lock` under `mcp_server/data/`; the sdist already carried `presets/` + `requirements.lock`. Focused manifest assertions live in the consolidated evidence tests. No `MANIFEST.in` added — hatch config is authoritative.

**Note:** enabling FTS5 by default remains **deferred pending evidence** — no performance gate was run for this release; `search.lexical_fast_path.enabled` stays `false`.

**No breaking changes.** Watcher defaults reproduce the prior hardcoded behavior exactly (`true` / `10.0`).

### v4.8.5 (2026-08-13) — Enterprise observability: `/health` probes + JSON structured logging (opt-in)

**Recommended for anyone deploying HTTP/SSE transport behind load balancers, container orchestrators, or centralised logging pipelines.** Two additive features, both zero-cost when unused: an HTTP `/health` and `/healthz` endpoint served in front of the MCP dispatcher (no auth required, always responds), and opt-in JSON structured logging ready for ELK / Loki / Datadog / CloudWatch Logs ingestion.

**Added:**

- **feat(health)** — new `mcp_server.health.HealthMiddleware` ASGI middleware exposes `GET /health` and `GET /healthz` returning `{"status":"ok","version":"4.8.5","uptime_seconds":<int>,"cache":<stats-or-null>}` on port `server.port` (same port as the MCP transport). Wired in front of the bearer auth middleware so probes always succeed regardless of the auth configuration. Cache statistics are best-effort — a failing orchestrator getter never flips the probe negative. 13 regression tests covering payload shape, delegation to the downstream app, bearer-auth interaction and custom paths.
- **feat(logging)** — new `mcp_server.logging_config` module. Set `server.logging.format: "json"` in `config.yaml` (default `"text"`) to install a `JsonFormatter` on the `knowledge_rag` logger that emits one JSON object per record on stderr with a stable core (`timestamp`, `level`, `logger`, `message`, `module`, `line`) plus any `extra={...}` fields. Level configurable via `server.logging.level` (default `"INFO"`). Existing `print(...)` sites are intentionally untouched — migration to `get_logger(__name__)` is incremental. 16 regression tests covering opt-in gate, payload shape, handler idempotency, foreign-handler preservation, exception serialisation and coercion of non-JSON-serialisable extras.

**Config schema additions** (both optional, both backwards-compatible):

```yaml
server:
  logging:
    format: "text"    # "text" (default, no-op) | "json"
    level: "INFO"     # DEBUG | INFO | WARNING | ERROR | CRITICAL
```

**No breaking changes.** Backwards compat verified by `check_api_surface.py` (only additive changes: new `health` and `logging_config` modules exported). All 13 MCP tool parameter names still frozen.
- **docs(polish)** — recover 6 didactic bits that were dropped during the README v5 migration (PR #181). No lost features; only cookbook material: (1) `hybrid_alpha` recipe with 5 α values and paired example queries in `docs/CONFIGURATION.md#hybrid-search-tuning`; (2) `documents/` folder tree example showing how paths map to categories in `docs/CONFIGURATION.md#organizing-your-documents-folder`; (3) copy-paste Python cookbook snippets for `add_document` / `update_document` / `remove_document` / `add_from_url` / `search_similar` / `reindex_documents` / `evaluate_retrieval` in `docs/API.md`; (4) full JSON example for `evaluate_retrieval` with 5 real test cases + metric interpretation cheat-sheet; (5) `multilingual` preset now listed alongside the other 4 in `docs/CONFIGURATION.md#presets` (bug inherited from the legacy README — never listed); (6) hero social proof restored: "1 800+ files / 39 K chunks indexed in <3 min" bullet added under `## Numbers that matter`; "No Docker mandatory. No Ollama required. No separate embedding server" callout restored on the Zero-friction-setup card.
- **feat(bench)** — redesign the live performance dashboard at https://lyonzin.github.io/knowledge-rag/ with an executive-focused UI: hero + theme toggle + KPI grid per subsystem (search/FTS5/reindex/indexing/memory/concurrent) with health status, Chart.js log-scale horizontal bars, category breakdown cards, sortable+filterable table, methodology section, dark-mode default, print-friendly. Replaces the 40-line inline heredoc in `bench-pages.yml` with reviewable, versioned static assets under `bench/dashboard/` (`index.html` + `styles.css` + `dashboard.js` + `build.py` + `README.md`).

### v4.8.4 (2026-08-13) — Patch: security + durability + defensive fixes

**Recommended upgrade for anyone running HTTP/SSE transport with bearer auth on a non-loopback host, or relying on `reindex_documents(force=True)`.** Four independent fixes accumulated since v4.8.3: one previously blocked remote-with-auth deployments (#174), one silently corrupted durable index metadata after a failed rebuild (#173), and two defensive fixes hardened `.ipynb` ingestion (#175) and the nightly chaos suite (#164).

**Fixed:**

- **fix(security)** — create the HTTP MCP app with the configured `server_host`. On the bearer-auth path the app factory was called without a host, so it defaulted to `127.0.0.1` and MCP 2.0.0's localhost-only DNS-rebinding allowlist rejected a configured non-loopback host with `421 Invalid Host header` before auth ran — even though uvicorn was bound to that host. Remote/LAN deployments with auth are now reachable (#174).
- **fix(reindex)** — restore durable metadata on a failed zero-downtime rebuild. The staging populate path persisted the staging map to `index_metadata.json` before validation ran; when validation failed, rollback restored only the in-memory `_indexed_docs`, leaving the file describing staging while memory held production. After a restart `_load_metadata` trusted the stale file, corrupting skip/update and embedding-dimension decisions. Rollback now re-persists the restored production metadata (#173).
- **fix(ingestion)** — `_parse_ipynb` handled invalid JSON gracefully but then assumed the parsed notebook was a well-formed dict. A valid-JSON notebook with a null `metadata` or `cells` field, a non-dict cell, a bare list, or a dict cell whose `source` is not `str | list[str]` (a number, a dict, or a list with non-string items) crashed with `AttributeError`/`TypeError`. Guarded the notebook, `metadata`, `cells`, cell, and cell `source` lookups so a parseable-but-malformed notebook is handled the same as any other odd input (#175, thanks @eeshsaxena).
- **fix(ci)** — the nightly chaos job (`pytest -m chaos`) aborted collection with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'hypothesis'` because `tests/test_query_router.py` imported hypothesis at module top-level while the chaos job installs only `pytest psutil numpy`. Guarded the import with `pytest.importorskip("hypothesis")` so the module is skipped cleanly instead of failing the whole nightly run (#164).

**Docs:**

- **docs(architecture)** — sync the 4 Mermaid diagrams in `## Architecture` (System Overview, Query Processing Flow, Document Ingestion Flow, hybrid_alpha Parameter Effect) with the v4.8.2 FTS5 fast-path (ADR-002/003/006), the v4.8.3 `_write_collection` staging dispatcher (#161), and the current 8-category layout. The diagrams previously described only the pre-v4.8 hybrid pipeline and 4-category storage; they now also show FTS5 dispatch, fallback semantics, FTS5 CRUD sync (ADR-008), and the zero-downtime staging write path. `hybrid_alpha` now clarifies that the fast-path bypasses RRF entirely so the weighting only matters on the hybrid path.

**No breaking changes.** Backwards compat verified by `check_api_surface.py` (zero diff vs baseline). All 13 MCP tool parameter names frozen (verified by `tests/test_backwards_compat.py`).

### v4.8.3 (2026-08-10) — Critical hotfix: nuclear-rebuild + smart-reindex hardening

**Recommended upgrade for any corpus with >1000 chunks or any user relying on `reindex_documents(force=True)` after a config change.** The v4.8.0 nuclear rebuild + v4.8.2 FTS5 fast-path have several latent state-management bugs that only trigger under a real-world combination (large corpus + rebuild + concurrent queries + FTS5 opt-in). Enterprise users with hacktricks-scale corpora (~50k+ chunks) are affected.

Fixes 3 GitHub issues opened by @grishkovei against v4.8.1:

- **Fixes #161** — `_rebuild_via_swap()` no longer rebinds `self.collection` to the empty staging collection during populate. Writes now route through the new `_write_collection` property (returns `self._staging_target` when set, else production). Queries keep reading `self.collection` unchanged. Zero-downtime is now real, not just a docs promise. `nuclear_rebuild(swap=True)` on 50k-chunk corpora previously served empty results for the entire hours-long populate window; queries now hit production until the atomic swap completes.
- **Fixes #162** — Smart-reindex checkpoint now serializes only doc-ids the current run actually committed (via new `tracking["committed_this_run"]` set), not the full `_indexed_docs.keys()` snapshot. A document that changed on disk before the reindex reached it is no longer silently skipped on resume — its mtime/size delta is properly detected.
- **Fixes #163** — `reindex_documents(force=True)` now propagates through to `index_all(force=True)`. The v4.8 migration path (`docs/migration-v4.8.0.md`) documented `force=True` as the way to re-embed after prefix/model changes; the hardcoded `force=False` in `reindex_all()` silently skipped every unchanged file. Prefix-only changes no longer leave mixed old/new embedding conventions.

Additional fixes discovered while triaging production issues on a 5889-doc / 75016-chunk corpus:

- **fix(indexing)** — `_index_lock` moved from class-level to instance-level (`__init__`). The class-level `threading.Lock` was silently shared across all `KnowledgeOrchestrator` instances, so a staging orchestrator from a previous `nuclear_rebuild` swap could be garbage-collected while holding the lock, leaving every subsequent `reindex_documents` returning `reindex_already_running` despite `active: false`. Requires daemon restart to recover pre-fix.
- **fix(chromadb)** — `_ensure_bm25_initialized` and `_iter_chroma_chunks_for_fts5` now batch-read Chroma via `offset+limit=500` instead of `collection.get(limit=count)`. Chromadb 1.x rebuilds an `IN (?, ?, ...)` clause per returned row, so a single `limit=48184` call blew past SQLite's default `max_variable_number=999` with `Internal error: too many SQL variables`. Any user with >999 chunks who ran nuclear rebuild or triggered the FTS5 lazy migration got a silently failed rebuild.
- **fix(fts5)** — `Fts5LexicalIndex.is_ready()` now re-reads the marker file when the cached `_ready` is False. Previously an orchestrator instantiated during nuclear-swap while the FTS5 migration was still running cached `_ready=False` forever and never re-checked the marker, permanently silencing the fast-path.
- **fix(fts5)** — `_maybe_start_fts5_migration` cross-checks FTS5 row count vs Chroma count on startup. A stale `complete` marker paired with a near-empty FTS5 index (post-swap orphan cleanup, manual truncate, disk corruption) previously left the fast-path silent forever. The new `_fts5_marker_matches_reality` helper triggers rebuild when FTS5 holds less than 10% of Chroma's row count.
- **fix(fts5)** — `_format_fts5_results` skips orphan hits (FTS5 has the `chunk_id` but Chroma doesn't — nuclear-rebuild residue or manual-delete race). Previously emitted empty result items with `source=""` that broke reranking and polluted result lists.
- **fix(indexing, config)** — Added `Fts5LexicalIndex.count()` for the new sanity check.

All 6 core fixes were confirmed via production reproduction on a 75016-chunk corpus + 2052 newly-added catalog documents; the `nuclear_rebuild(full_rebuild=True)` path now completes cleanly and populates FTS5 with 75016 rows on first attempt.

Migration path: `pip install -U knowledge-rag==4.8.3` (or `npx -y knowledge-rag@4.8.3` / `docker pull ghcr.io/lyonzin/knowledge-rag:4.8.3`) then restart the MCP daemon. No config changes required. If your FTS5 index is corrupted from a prior partial rebuild (marker says `complete` but queries return empty), delete `data/fts5_migration.state` and restart — the daemon will detect the drift and rebuild automatically.

### v4.8.2 (2026-08-10) — FTS5 Lexical Fast-Path Opt-In Release (default OFF)

v4.8.2 bundles Fases 1–5 of the FTS5 Lexical Fast-Path plan
(`.compozy/tasks/fts5-lexical-fast-path/`) as an **opt-in** release —
`search.lexical_fast_path.enabled` remains `false` by default, so users
who do not touch `config.yaml` keep v4.8.1 behaviour byte-for-byte
(LEI 1 preserved). The v4.9.0 default flip is deferred to the CI
perf-gate adjudication documented in ADR-009 (bench harness ships in
this release; the flip PR follows once G1 ≥15× and G2 ≤2% both pass on
CI hardware).

- **DOCS (search)**: new `docs/features/fts5_fast_path.md` user guide
  covering overview / quick-start / 5-key config reference / how it
  works / 5 troubleshooting scenarios / when-to-use guidance. README
  Configuration section cross-links it.
- **NEW (bench)**: `bench/test_bench_fts5_lexical.py` ships the
  BENCH-001 (cold, p95 ≤ 10ms target) + BENCH-002 (hot, p95 ≤ 2ms
  target) harness against a self-contained 3865-row FTS5 corpus. The
  gate G2 comparison against `bench/test_bench_search.py` is executed
  by CI per `.compozy/tasks/fts5-lexical-fast-path/bench_v4_9_0_gate.md`;
  the two-round A/B was not run locally because the release-authoring
  workstation cannot fairly baseline against CI hardware (ADR-004
  §Risks).
- **DOCS (adr)**: new ADR-009 documenting why the ADR-004 gate is
  deferred to the CI perf-gate step and what conditions unlock the
  v4.9.0 flip PR.
- **CHANGE (config)**: `config.example.yaml` uncomments the
  `search.lexical_fast_path.*` block so new users see the full
  configuration surface (still `enabled: false`). Existing installs
  are unaffected.
- **VERSION**: 4.8.1 → **4.8.2** (PATCH — opt-in infrastructure + docs,
  zero behaviour change on the default install).
- **feat (search)**: FTS5 lazy background migration for existing corpus + CRUD sync (ADR-008). `Fts5LexicalIndex` gains `add_document`/`update_document`/`remove_document` (SQL INSERT/DELETE under `_fts5_lock`, incremental — diverges from BM25's full-rebuild pattern because FTS5 mutations are O(1) native SQL) and `start_migration_background(chunk_iter_factory, docs_total, resume_from=0, on_progress=...)` (daemon thread that persists checkpoint every 100 rows into the marker file). On daemon startup, `_maybe_start_fts5_migration` reads the marker: `complete` = fast-path live, `in_progress` = resume from `docs_indexed`, `failed`/missing = start fresh migration; queries during migration fall back to hybrid + emit `fast_path_fallback_total{reason="disabled"}`. `KnowledgeOrchestrator.{add,update,remove}_document_*` gain best-effort FTS5 sync hooks after the BM25 rebuild — errors are caught, logged, and counted (`fast_path_errors_total{error_class="Fts5CrudSyncError"}`) but never propagate to the CRUD tool (upstream write must keep succeeding). `nuclear_rebuild` and `_rebuild_bm25_post_swap` drop the FTS5 db + WAL/SHM/marker and dispatch a fresh migration from the swapped-in Chroma corpus. Two Prometheus gauges expose migration progress (`knowledge_rag_fast_path_migration_docs_indexed`, `_docs_total`). Standalone rebuild helper `scripts/build_fts5_index.py --data-dir <path> [--force] [--foreground] [--verbose]` for operator-driven repair. Operational runbook in `docs/runbooks/fts5_migration.md` covering enable / wait / verify / manual rebuild / large-corpus caveat. New coverage: `tests/test_fts5_migration.py` (17 tests — TestMigrationLifecycle UT-043..048, TestCRUDSync UT-049..052, TestMigrationIntegration IT-021..023, TestCRUDSyncIntegration IT-CRUD-001..004) + `tests/test_e2e_fts5.py::test_e2e006_forced_fts5_with_migration_pending_raises` (E2E-006). Fase 4 of the FTS5 Lexical Fast-Path plan.
- **NEW (search)**: Optional cross-encoder rerank toggle on the FTS5 fast-path via `search.lexical_fast_path.rerank_enabled` (default `false` — see ADR-003 for rationale). When `true`, `KnowledgeOrchestrator._run_fts5_search` layers `CrossEncoderReranker.rerank` on top of the FTS5 results before adjacent-chunk expansion; result items keep `search_method="fts5"` (rerank is a rescorer, not a path change) and `reranker_score` is populated. When `false`, the `knowledge_rag_fast_path_rerank_skipped_total` counter increments and the fast-path stays under the <10ms lexical latency budget. Empirical basis: Flash-Rerank MiniLM-L-6-v2 CPU ≈72ms/100 docs vs the <10ms target — keeping rerank OFF by default is the correct trade-off; opt in only when recall on lexical queries matters more than latency. New coverage: `tests/test_search.py::TestRerankToggle` (UT-062, UT-063, IT-024, IT-025). Fase 3.5 of the FTS5 Lexical Fast-Path plan.
- **NEW (search)**: FTS5 lexical fast-path dispatch wired inside `KnowledgeOrchestrator.query()` behind the opt-in `search.lexical_fast_path.enabled` toggle (default `false` — v4.8.1 behavior byte-for-byte for users who don't touch config). When enabled, the query router (Fase 2) classifies each query; lexical queries dispatch to the FTS5 index (Fase 1) via a new `_maybe_dispatch_fts5` helper, semantic queries flow through the existing hybrid pipeline. Per ADR-003 the cross-encoder reranker is skipped on the fast-path (real opt-in toggle deferred to Task 04). Per ADR-006 the `search_knowledge` MCP tool gains one optional param `search_method: Literal["auto","hybrid","fts5"] = "auto"` — additive-safe on the LEI 1 backward-compat contract. Explicit `"fts5"` when the feature is disabled OR the index is not ready raises `Fts5NotReadyError` and the MCP wrapper surfaces it as a JSON error envelope with a `suggestion` field pointing at `search_method='auto'`. `QueryCache._make_key` gains a 5th `search_method` param so paths cannot share cache entries. `MetricsCollector` gains five FTS5 counters plus a bucketed latency histogram (`knowledge_rag_fast_path_hits_total{path}`, `..._fallback_total{reason}`, `..._latency_seconds`, `..._errors_total{error_class}`, `..._rerank_skipped_total`) exposed through `/metrics`. New coverage: `tests/test_search_method_override.py` (5 IT), `tests/test_metrics.py` (2 UT), `tests/test_e2e_fts5.py` (7 E2E), and extensions to `tests/test_search.py` (16 IT/UT — dispatch, config toggle, cache key, metrics scrape), `tests/test_backwards_compat.py` (3 UT — MCP tool signature + guardrail), `tests/test_fts5_index.py` (3 UT — fallback dispatch, busy_timeout, NotReady message). Fase 3 of the FTS5 Lexical Fast-Path plan.
- **NEW (search)**: Query router lexical/semantic classifier (`mcp_server/query_router.py`) ships isolated and unused. Static regex classifier per ADR-002 — patterns are pre-compiled at construction (fail-fast on `re.error`) and matched in YAML-declared order (first-match-wins, OQ-2). API surface: `QueryRouter(patterns: Sequence[str])` plus `classify(query: str) -> Literal["lexical", "semantic"]`; empty query classifies as `"semantic"` (safe default). Zero coupling to `mcp_server/fts5_index` — the router is storage-agnostic. Task 03 will wire the dispatch inside `KnowledgeOrchestrator.query()` behind `config.fts5_enabled`; this PR is deliberately unwired so runtime behaviour is preserved. New coverage in `tests/test_query_router.py` (19 tests covering UT-001..UT-013 including a `hypothesis` property test). Fase 2 of the FTS5 Lexical Fast-Path plan (`.compozy/tasks/fts5-lexical-fast-path/`).
- **NEW (search)**: FTS5 lexical index module (`mcp_server/fts5_index.py`) ships isolated and unused behind the opt-in `search.lexical_fast_path.enabled` config field (default `false`). Encapsulates the dedicated `data/fts5_index.db` SQLite FTS5 store with the ADR-005 tokenizer (`unicode61 remove_diacritics 2 tokenchars '-_.'`) so composite identifiers like `MDR-AD002`, `CVE-2021-4034`, `T1078.001`, `pass-the-hash`, `context.py` survive tokenization intact. Public surface: `Fts5LexicalIndex` (search + connection lifecycle + WAL/busy_timeout=5000ms/synchronous=NORMAL PRAGMAs per ADR-001), `Fts5MigrationState` (atomic JSON marker via `tempfile` + `fsync` + `os.replace`), and three `RuntimeError`-derived exceptions (`Fts5NotReadyError`, `Fts5CorruptError`, `Fts5MigrationError`) per ADR-004/Q4. `Config` gains four `fts5_*` fields (`fts5_enabled`, `fts5_min_hits`, `fts5_rerank_enabled`, `fts5_patterns`) backed by a new `_get_nested()` helper that mirrors the `models.reranker.*` pattern. `config.example.yaml` documents the new `search.lexical_fast_path.*` block (commented out). All FTS5 queries use prepared statements and every user-supplied token is quoted so FTS5 metacharacters (`MATCH`, `NEAR`, `OR`, `AND`, `NOT`, `*`, `:`, `(`, `)`, `"`) cannot leak through. Task 03 will wire the dispatch inside `KnowledgeOrchestrator.query()`; this PR is deliberately unwired so runtime behaviour of v4.8.1 is preserved byte-for-byte. New coverage in `tests/test_fts5_index.py` (25 tests covering UT-020..028, UT-054..058, UT-061, IT-MIG-001) and `tests/test_config_fts5.py` (9 tests covering UT-030..038). Fase 1 of the FTS5 Lexical Fast-Path plan (`.compozy/tasks/fts5-lexical-fast-path/`).

### v4.8.0 (2026-08-06) — Multilingual Foundation + Zero-Downtime Reindex

v4.8.0 é a release de fundação para migração pra embeddings multilingual (`intfloat/multilingual-e5-large`) sem forçar downtime nem breaking change. Sete fases entregaram: security wire (7 vetores fechados que existiam desde v4.5.1), embedding profiles com prefix opt-in, GPU auto-detect com dependency chain documentada, batch/parallel indexing configurável + fix da assimetria BM25/semantic candidate pool, progress granular + resume checkpoint, dual-collection swap zero-downtime, e refactor pra manter complexidade Radon C+ na superfície tocada.

Zero breaking change: usuários que atualizarem SEM tocar em `config.yaml` continuam com `bge-small-en-v1.5` byte-for-byte. Opt-in para multilingual: `profile: "multilingual"` + `reindex_documents(force=True)` — durante o reindex, RAG continua servindo da collection antiga (zero downtime via staging swap). Detalhes de upgrade em `docs/migration-v4.8.0.md`.

- **REFACTOR (server + config)**: extracted 40+ helpers from 12 functions touched by v4.8.0 F1–F5 to enforce Core hard limits (function ≤30 lines). Biggest wins — `KnowledgeOrchestrator._index_all_impl` split from 246 → 23 lines (14 focused helpers covering setup / per-doc processing / progress metrics / persistence / teardown), `Config.__post_init__` split from 185 → 12 lines (13 domain validators), `reindex_documents` MCP tool from 100 → 30 lines (mode resolution + resume hydration + response formatting extracted to module helpers). Also refactored `_index_document` (91→19), `_rebuild_via_swap` (66→29), `_validate_staging` (56→24), `_cleanup_stale_staging_collections` (48→26), `get_reindex_status` (49→12), `_print_gpu_banner` (46→20), `start_reindex_background` (46→26), `_swap_collections_atomic` (43→25), `_route_load` (41→9). New sentinel `_SKIP_DOC` distinguishes "caller must skip" from "index as fresh" in the per-doc worker. Radon complexity average dropped from D (23.4) to C (17.2); zero D+ functions remain in F1–F5 touched surface. File-level extract (`server.py` = 4009 lines, `config.py` = 990 lines) deferred to v4.9.0 because `test_backwards_compat.py` validates the MCP contract by AST and moving classes across modules multiplies regression surface. Zero behavior change — full test sweep (`test_config` + `test_embedding_profile` + `test_gpu_auto` + `test_batch_parallel` + `test_reindex_resume` + `test_swap_zero_downtime` + `test_backwards_compat` + `test_bm25_*` + `test_search` + `test_dedup` + `test_ingestion*` + `test_lazy_embeddings` + `test_reranker_fallback` + `tests/security/` + all misc) = 557 passed / 3 skipped / 9 xfailed / 0 failed. Full audit report in `docs/refactor-audit-v4.8.0-fase-6.md`. v4.8.0 Fase 6.
- **PERF (reindex)**: `nuclear_rebuild(swap=True)` is now the default, replacing the destructive-first rebuild that took the RAG offline for the entire duration (4min–40h depending on corpus + hardware). New workflow — cleanup stale stagings (24h TTL) → snapshot orchestrator state (`self.collection` / `self.bm25_index` / `self._indexed_docs` / `self._source_to_docid`) → create `{collection_name}__staging_{unix_ts}` (timestamped to avoid collisions with concurrent or previously-crashed rebuilds) → populate via temporary orchestrator rebind (`self.collection` points at staging, `self.bm25_index` is a throwaway `BM25Index()` so production BM25 keeps serving queries throughout) → validate three gates (`count >= baseline * 0.9` with 10% loss threshold for parser-skipped docs / 4 of 5 canonical queries `readme/function/import/return/class` return hits / `query()` does not raise, catching embedding dim mismatches) → atomic two-step swap via `Collection.modify(name=)` (prod → `__old_{ts}` frees the name, staging → prod assumes it, delete `__old_{ts}` non-fatally) with rollback-rename on mid-swap failure → post-swap BM25 rebuild from swapped-in ChromaDB contents + query cache invalidation. Any failure in populate/validate/swap triggers rollback via the snapshot and staging cleanup — production sees zero net change. Startup cleanup handles crash-orphaned stagings automatically (also runs before each rebuild). Storage doubles temporarily during rebuild (both collections on disk), back to 1x after swap. `nuclear_rebuild(swap=False)` preserves the legacy destructive behavior byte-for-byte in `_rebuild_destructive` for backwards compat / forced-cleanup edge cases. New `tests/test_swap_zero_downtime.py` (15 tests, ~1.7s, all mocked — no real ChromaDB or FastEmbed touched) covers naming format + populate BM25 isolation + all three validation gates + fresh-install zero-baseline path + post-swap `self.collection` reconnect + BM25 rebuild only after swap success + 100 parallel queries against a captured production handle during populate (zero errors, non-empty results) + stale/recent staging cleanup + non-staging collection preservation + backwards-compat dispatch. Docs in `docs/reindex-operations.md` section "Zero-downtime Rebuild (v4.8.0 Fase 5+)". v4.8.0 Fase 5.
- **NEW (reindex)**: `reindex_documents(resume=True)` recovers from `data/reindex_checkpoint.json` after an interrupted smart reindex. Checkpoint is written every 500 docs or 30s (whichever first), and stores `indexed_doc_ids` + `chunks_processed` + `config_signature` (SHA256 of `embedding_model | embedding_dim | chunk_size | chunk_overlap`). A config mismatch between checkpoint write and resume load invalidates the checkpoint with a WARN — this prevents a mixed collection (partial old-model vectors + partial new-model vectors) which would silently degrade retrieval. The combination `resume=True + full_rebuild=True` is rejected with a structured error because nuclear rebuild wipes the collection first — resuming into a partial state would leave no coherent index. The `resume=True` flag also implicitly forces `mode='smart_reindex'` even when `force=False` was passed, so an interrupted smart run cannot silently fall back to `incremental` (which would ignore the checkpoint entirely). Existing 2-arg `reindex_documents(force, full_rebuild)` signature preserved — `resume` is an opt-in tail kwarg. Missing / corrupt / future-version / non-dict checkpoints all degrade gracefully to "start fresh" instead of raising. Written to `data/reindex_checkpoint.json` via atomic `.tmp` + `os.replace()` — Windows-safe on NTFS in-directory. Cleared automatically on successful reindex completion. Metadata (`index_metadata.json`) is flushed alongside every checkpoint write so `_indexed_docs` on disk stays in sync with the checkpoint's `indexed_doc_ids` list. New `tests/test_reindex_resume.py` (22 tests, all `object.__new__` isolation — no ChromaDB, no FastEmbed download) covers write cadence + atomic write + schema + load validation (6 failure modes) + resume kwarg happy path + rejection combos + status field flow. v4.8.0 Fase 4.
- **NEW (reindex)**: `get_reindex_status()` now returns 6 new fields during active reindex — `chunks_processed` (chunks committed to ChromaDB so far), `chunks_total` (rolling estimate, 0 during warmup then running average from completed docs × `total_files`), `throughput_cps` (chunks/sec, sliding window bounded by the smaller of 100 samples or 30 seconds — deque `maxlen=100` combined with age-based pruning each iteration keeps the number stable during transient stalls without diluting current speed with ancient samples), `eta_seconds` (estimated seconds to completion, derived from throughput + remaining chunks, guarded against div-by-zero), `checkpoint_saved_at` (ISO timestamp of last checkpoint write, `null` until first checkpoint at 500 docs / 30s), `resumed` (bool — `true` when the current run was recovered from a checkpoint via `resume=True`, `false` otherwise). Enables real-time progress dashboards and the "should I keep waiting or restart" call. Idle path (`active: false`) unchanged — still returns just `last_result` or `last_error`. v4.8.0 Fase 4.
- **DOCS (reindex)**: `docs/reindex-operations.md` NEW — documents the sync-vs-async gotcha for `reindex_documents(full_rebuild=True)` (daemon thread dies with process → RAG offline until manual restart), recommends `orchestrator.nuclear_rebuild()` sync for CLI scripts and `reindex_documents(force=True) + resume=True` for long unstable smart rebuilds. Also covers resume semantics (only valid with `full_rebuild=False`, implicitly forces `smart_reindex` mode, graceful degrade to fresh start on missing/corrupt/version/signature mismatch), checkpoint cadence (500 docs OR 30s, whichever first, plus rationale for the OR condition), `config_signature` invalidation semantic, full lifecycle (write on cadence, clear on success, clear on failed resume load), progress fields table with warmup behavior, example recovery flow showing crash → `ls checkpoint` → `resume=True` → poll status with `resumed:true` marker, and escalation rules of thumb for the three most likely operator questions. v4.8.0 Fase 4.
- **PERF (indexing)**: `documents.batch_size` (default 500) and `documents.parallel_workers` (default 1, opt-in) are now configurable in `config.yaml`. The previously hardcoded `_CHROMA_BATCH_SIZE = 500` in `server.py:_index_document` continues as fallback constant for tests that instantiate the orchestrator without a full `Config` (via `object.__new__`, as `tests/test_search.py` does). When `parallel_workers > 1` AND the document produces more than one batch, the per-batch `collection.add(...)` calls run inside a `ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=parallel_workers)`. Single-batch documents skip the pool entirely — no orchestration overhead to extract from a single call. Gain comes from SQLite writes overlapping with the NEXT batch's ONNX inference (embedding itself is serialized by ONNX session lock — never parallel inference). Windows users should monitor stability at `workers > 4` (extra `[WARN]` on startup). `batch_size` clamped to `[1, 5000]`, `parallel_workers` clamped to `[1, 16]` — out-of-range values are clamped with a `[WARN]`. New `bench/test_bench_reindex.py` (3 benchmarks) uses a `_SleepingCollection` stub with 5ms per-`add()` sleep so the parallel path measurably overlaps without depending on a real ChromaDB; local numbers: reindex_batch_2000 5.66ms, reindex_default 5.68ms, reindex_parallel_4 7.30ms (200-chunk doc, 4 concurrent batches, sequential would be ~20ms). New `tests/test_batch_parallel.py` (20 tests, ~1.6s) covers config parsing, clamping, Windows-only warn on `workers > 4`, sequential vs parallel dispatch, single-batch skip, `getattr` fallback to `_CHROMA_BATCH_SIZE`, exception propagation via `.result()`, and empty-doc short-circuit. Defaults preserve v4.7.1 behavior byte-for-byte. v4.8.0 Fase 3.
- **FIX (search)**: `search.max_results` default raised from `20` to `100`. This eliminates the asymmetric candidate pool in hybrid retrieval where `_do_semantic` clamped candidates to `min(max_results * 3, config.max_results) = min(15, 20) = 20` while BM25 pulled up to `max_results * 20 = 400` — semantic silently starved without any log signal, degrading hybrid retrieval quality on any query where the semantic branch could have contributed better candidates. Callers passing `max_results` explicitly in the MCP tool call (`search_knowledge`, `search_similar`) are unaffected — only the config-loaded default changed. New `TestDoSemanticCandidateMath` class in `tests/test_search.py` (2 tests) pins the fix against future regressions: `test_semantic_asks_chromadb_for_3x_max_results` proves the 3× semantic candidate pool, `test_semantic_pool_is_bounded_by_config_max_results` proves the cap still works when `max_results * 3` exceeds it. v4.8.0 Fase 3.
- **CHANGE (gpu)**: `models.embedding.gpu` is now tri-state (`"auto"` | `"true"` | `"false"`) with `"auto"` as the new default. In auto mode, `FastEmbedEmbeddings.verify_gpu_readiness()` runs four startup checks (`CUDAExecutionProvider` present in `onnxruntime.get_available_providers()` / required NVIDIA DLLs reachable via `PATH` — `cudart64_12.dll`, `cudnn64_9.dll`, `cublasLt64_12.dll` on Windows and their `.so.12` / `.so.9` counterparts on Linux / `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=name,memory.total` exits 0 / a minimal single-op ONNX `InferenceSession` initializes on the CUDA provider) and uses CUDA when all pass, CPU otherwise. Legacy bool `gpu: true`/`gpu: false` continues to work — normalized to the string form internally. The startup banner now prints on every path (including CPU-only and fallback), reports the mode (`auto-cuda` / `auto-cpu-fallback` / `forced-cpu` / `forced-cuda` / `forced-cuda-fallback`), and surfaces the probe `fallback_reason` on CPU paths with a hint pointing at the full pip install chain. Full dependency chain (onnxruntime-gpu CUDA 12 variant via `--extra-index-url` + `nvidia-cudnn-cu12` + `nvidia-cublas-cu12` + siblings) and troubleshooting for the six most common failures documented in `docs/gpu-setup.md`. Zero behavior change for users who had `gpu: false` explicitly. New coverage in `tests/test_gpu_auto.py` (13 tests, all mocked — no real GPU required to run). v4.8.0 Fase 2. (#149)
- **NEW (embedding)**: `models.embedding.profile` opt-in preset (`compact` | `quality` | `multilingual` | `custom`) plus `query_prefix` / `passage_prefix` fields. The `multilingual` profile ships `intfloat/multilingual-e5-large` (1024D, 100+ languages) with the required `"query: "` / `"passage: "` prefixes wired into `FastEmbedEmbeddings.__call__`, `.embed_query`, and `.embed_documents`. `compact` preserves the current `bge-small-en-v1.5` default byte-for-byte. Changing profile or prefix requires `reindex_documents(force=True)` because existing chunks were embedded without the new prefix. (#148)
- **FIX (bm25)**: BM25 tokenizer is now Unicode-aware. Before this fix, the `[a-z0-9]` character class in `BM25Index._tokenize()` and `_metadata_path_score()` (server.py:652, 659, 720) dropped every code point outside Basic Latin — Cyrillic, Greek, CJK, Arabic corpora silently degraded to semantic-only search (empty `bm25_rank`, `search_method: semantic`, no warning). Portuguese/Spanish/French text with diacritics was **fragmented** on the accent: `"informação técnica"` tokenised as `['informa', 'o', 't', 'cnica']` and BM25 scored garbage fragments instead of the actual words. The regex now uses `[^\W_]+(?:-[^\W_]+)*` which keeps hyphenated composites (`CVE-2024-1234`, `rule-a002`, `pass-the-hash`) byte-identical to prior behaviour while also matching letters from any script. All 28 tests in `test_bm25_tokenizer_fragment.py` remain green. New coverage in `tests/test_bm25_unicode_tokenizer.py` (13 tests) exercises Cyrillic / Greek / Arabic / CJK / PT-BR / mixed-script / composite-with-diacritics / underscore-separation. Closes #145. (#147)
- **DOCS (security)**: rewrite `SECURITY.md` reporting section — remove the `lyonzin@users.noreply.github.com` fallback (GitHub `noreply.github.com` addresses are outbound-only and never receive mail, so that channel was decorative) and direct all reports to the GitHub Security Advisory form at `/security/advisories/new`. Private vulnerability reporting is now enabled on the repo, so the form is available to any GitHub user without collaborator status. Closes #146. (#147)
- **FIX (security)**: wire `validate_path_within` on all filepath-taking orchestrator tools — `get_document`, `add_document_from_content`, `update_document_content`, `remove_document_by_path`, `search_similar`. Escape attempts return a structured `{"error": "Filepath rejected: ..."}` and touch nothing on disk. Closes 5 latent path traversal / arbitrary-file-{read,write,delete} vectors that the `mcp_server/security.py` primitives had covered since v4.5.1 but which never had callers in the mutation path. (#147)
- **FIX (security)**: wire `sanitize_external_content` on `add_from_url`. The fetched body now flows through a new `external_source` kwarg on `add_document_from_content` (default `None` — operator ingests stay byte-identical) which fences it in a provenance envelope and defuses known prompt-injection sentinels (`<|im_start|>`, `[INST]`, etc.) before the parser or any downstream LLM sees it. Closes OWASP LLM01:2025 on the URL ingest path. (#147)
- **FIX (security)**: install `BearerAuthMiddleware` on HTTP transports (`sse`, `streamable-http`) when `config.auth_bearer_token` is set. Wraps the FastMCP ASGI app and serves via uvicorn; unset token keeps prior `mcp.run()` open-port behaviour with a `[WARN]` on stderr; `stdio` transport is never wrapped. Closes the auth-bypass gap where `auth_bearer_token` had existed as a config field since v4.0.0 but was never compared. (#147)
- **NEW (tests)**: `tests/security/test_add_from_url_sanitized.py` and `tests/security/test_bearer_middleware_attached.py` — integration tests that prove the wire (not just the library primitives). The `@pytest.mark.xfail("integration pending v4.6.0")` markers on 9 tests across `test_path_traversal.py`, `test_bearer_auth.py`, `test_prompt_injection.py` are removed — they now pass. `tests/security/` totals: 138 passed, 7 skipped, 6 xfailed. (#147)
- **DOCS (perf)**: `docs/perf-baseline-v4.7.1.md` + `perf-baseline-v4.7.1.json` — reference microbenchmarks + `nuclear_rebuild()` timing (100-doc synthetic corpus) captured at the tip of v4.7.1. Non-runtime baseline for the planned Phase 3 batch-parallel embedding work in v4.8.0.
- **NEW (release automation)**: `release.yml` now has a `yank-superseded` job that reads a `YANKS:` marker from the release body and automatically yanks the listed version from PyPI + deprecates it on NPM after the new version publishes. Format: `YANKS: v4.7.0` or `YANKS: v4.7.0 — some reason`. Requires the `PYPI_API_TOKEN` repo secret (classic scoped token — Trusted Publisher OIDC does not currently support yank). Job runs after `publish-pypi`/`publish-npm`/`publish-docker`, is idempotent, and degrades gracefully when secrets are missing (emits `::warning::` instead of failing). If the marker is absent, the job is a no-op.

### v4.7.1 (2026-08-01) — Documentation Hygiene

- **CHORE (docs, tests)**: sanitize identifiers in test fixtures and CHANGELOG examples. v4.7.0 referenced code names from a real deployment corpus in `tests/test_bm25_tokenizer_fragment.py` and the v4.7.0 CHANGELOG entry; those are replaced with synthetic placeholders (`RULE-A00X`, `PROJECT-Custom001-xxxx`) and well-known public identifiers (`CVE-*`, `MS17-*`, `ADR-*`, `T1078.002`) that carry no organization-specific taxonomy. Zero behavior change — all 28 fragment tests pass unchanged, tokenizer logic identical.
- **NOTE**: v4.7.0 is **yanked from PyPI** and **deprecated on NPM** because its published README contained the same corporate example strings. The Docker tag `v4.7.0` remains (image tags are immutable) but `latest` now points to v4.7.1. Please upgrade — v4.7.0 and v4.7.1 are functionally equivalent.
- **VERSION**: 4.7.0 → **4.7.1** (PATCH — documentation hygiene, zero code / API / config change).

### v4.7.0 (2026-07-31) — BM25 Fragment Query Support ⚠️ **YANKED — use v4.7.1**

- **FIX (retrieval)**: BM25 tokenizer now emits **sub-tokens** for hyphenated alphanumeric-code composites, so fragment queries no longer silently return `NO_RESULTS`. Before v4.7.0, `RULE-A002` was indexed as a single token `rule-a002`; queries like `A002`, `RULE`, `B005` returned zero even when the composite lived in the corpus. This is not a bug specific to any naming scheme — it hit every hyphenated code taxonomy in typical infosec / doc corpora (`RULE-*`, `CVE-*`, `ADR-*`, `MS17-*`, `PROJECT-Custom001-xxxx`). The tokenizer now emits both the composite token AND its sub-parts of length ≥ 2 (`rule-a002` → `["rule-a002", "rule", "a002"]`). IDF preserves ranking — composite matches still rank above fragment matches because the composite is rarer. **Heuristic (perf-safety)**: sub-token expansion is triggered ONLY when the composite contains at least one digit — so `pass-the-hash`, `state-of-the-art`, and other natural-language hyphenated phrases stay as single tokens (expanding them would flood the inverted index with stop-word-like sub-parts and hurt concurrent-query throughput). (#140)
- **NEW (tests)**: `tests/test_bm25_tokenizer_fragment.py` — 28 tests across 4 classes covering unit tokenizer behavior, end-to-end fragment matching, multi-doc disambiguation, and the 5 query patterns explicitly reported (`RULE-A019`, `PROJECT-Custom001-xxxx`, `RULE`, `A019`, `B005`). Includes retrocompat sentinel + IDF ranking invariant. Baseline: 314 → 342.
- **UPGRADE NOTE**: run `reindex_documents(force=True)` once after upgrade to rebuild the BM25 inverted index with the new sub-token emission. ChromaDB vectors are untouched. Expect a **~30–50% increase in BM25 index memory** (measured +32.5% on synthetic corpus) — negligible for typical corpora, worth reviewing for deployments with >100K docs.
- **KNOWN LIMITATION**: alphanumeric-glued tokens without separators (single-token identifiers with no hyphens, hash prefixes) still require exact match — no sub-token expansion possible without character n-grams (5-10× index overhead). Tracked as follow-up.
- **VERSION**: 4.6.0 → **4.7.0** (MINOR — tokenization behavior change + reindex requirement, though no API/config break).

### v4.6.0 (2026-07-30) — MCP spec 2026-07-28 via Anthropic Tier 1 SDK (mcp 2.x)

- **NEW (protocol)**: adopt the [MCP spec `2026-07-28`](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2026-07-28/) — stateless request/response core, per-request `_meta.io.modelcontextprotocol/protocolVersion` + `clientCapabilities`, `serverInfo` on responses, retirement of the `initialize`/`initialized` handshake and the `Mcp-Session-Id` header. The MCP client Claude Code (and every Tier 1 client) negotiates the spec version per request, so this release stays backwards-compatible for clients speaking earlier spec revisions.
- **NEW (deps)**: bump `mcp` from `>=1.6.0,<2.0.0` to `>=2.0.0,<3.0.0`. Anthropic published `mcp 2.0.0` on 2026-07-28 as the Tier 1 Python SDK — it speaks the new spec natively and is the direct upstream reference. Delivers the follow-up promised in v4.5.0-post — no longer trapped on `mcp.server.fastmcp` which upstream `mcp 2.0.0` renamed to `mcp.server.MCPServer`.
- **CHANGE (imports)**: `mcp_server/server.py` now imports `MCPServer` from `mcp.server` instead of `FastMCP` from `mcp.server.fastmcp`. `@mcp.tool()` / `@mcp.resource()` / `@mcp.prompt()` decorator ergonomics are unchanged — only the class name and import path move. All 13 MCP tool signatures, all tool names, and every public function under `mcp_server.*` are **frozen and unchanged** — `check_api_surface.py --check` passes clean, `test_backwards_compat.py` stays green.
- **CHANGE (constructor)**: `MCPServer(...)` (like FastMCP 3.x) no longer accepts `host` / `port` on the constructor; those parameters now belong to the transport and are passed to `mcp.run(transport=..., host=..., port=...)` on the non-stdio branches. stdio users see zero behaviour change.
- **CHANGE (server identity)**: `MCPServer(name="knowledge-rag", version="4.6.0")` — server now advertises its version explicitly in `serverInfo`, matching the `2026-07-28` spec.
- **NON-GOAL — why not `fastmcp` (jlowin)**: an initial attempt via the third-party standalone `fastmcp` package added ~20 transitive dependencies (from its `[client,server]` extras) and pushed `test_bench_orchestrator_idle_rss` +21.9% and `test_bench_query_cache_5000_entries` +17.1% — a real regression, not jitter. Cutting the extras to `fastmcp-slim[mcp]` broke `@mcp.tool()` at runtime (`ImportError: FastMCP server support is not installed`). Anthropic's official `mcp 2.x` is the correct entry point.
- **VERSION**: 4.5.1 → **4.6.0** (MINOR — new spec adoption via Tier 1 SDK; every public API + every MCP tool signature preserved).

### v4.5.1 (2026-07-28) — Fase 1 Security Hardening (library, standalone)

- **NEW (security)**: Fase 1 Security Hardening — a standalone `mcp_server.security` library ships with the tools needed to close three attack classes against untrusted document ingestion. **Nothing in the existing call graph changes** in v4.5.1: `security.py` is imported by no other module in this release, so byte-identical behaviour is preserved for every user. Integration with `add_document` / `add_from_url` / `parse_file` / MCP HTTP transports lands in v4.6.0 (14 tests in `tests/security/` are marked `xfail` accordingly — they turn green once the callers are wired up). Users motivated to adopt hardening today can `from mcp_server.security import ...` explicitly. Contract per-defense:
  - **CWE-22 / CWE-59** path traversal + symlink escape: `validate_path_within(base, candidate)` + `is_path_within(base, candidate)` + `PathEscapeError`. Rejects `..`, absolute-outside-base, and symlinks whose target leaves the corpus root.
  - **OWASP LLM01:2025** prompt injection: `neutralize_injection_sentinels` + `sanitize_external_content` + `wrap_external_content` + `detect_external_marker`. Wraps content fetched from URLs / dropped files with tagged sentinels the downstream LLM can distinguish from operator-authored context.
  - **CWE-287** unauthenticated HTTP transport: `BearerAuthMiddleware` + `bearer_token_matches` (constant-time comparison) + `extract_bearer_token`. Attach to a Starlette / FastAPI app; stdio transport bypasses auth by construction (no network surface).
- **NEW**: `docs/adr/0001-fase1-security-hardening.md` — ADR capturing threat model + v4.6.0 integration roadmap.
- **NEW**: `.github/SECURITY.md` — GitHub vulnerability reporting policy pointer + `.github/openssf-best-practices.md` (evidence pack for OpenSSF Best Practices badge registration).
- **NEW**: `tests/security/` (71 tests total; 57 library unit tests green in v4.5.1, 14 integration tests `xfail` pending v4.6.0 wire-up, `strict=False` so they auto-turn-green after integration) + `tests/test_security_docs.py` (9 assertions pinning `SECURITY.md`, README badge block, dependabot weekly pip schedule).
- **DOCS**: README carries the OpenSSF Best Practices badge (placeholder project ID until registration completes).
- **DEPS**: `dependabot.yml` pip schedule tightened `monthly` → `weekly` (OpenSSF-recommended floor for language ecosystems).
- **VERSION**: 4.5.0 → **4.5.1** (PATCH — additive library only, zero behaviour change on the default install).

### v4.5.0-post (rolling fixes since v4.5.0 release)

- **FIX (deps)**: pin `mcp<2.0.0` in both `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml` after the upstream `mcp` package published 2.0.0, which drops/relocates `mcp.server.fastmcp`. Every `mcp_server.server` import chain — and therefore every test module — was failing collection with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mcp.server.fastmcp'` on fresh CI runners across all 9 OS×Python cells. Pin restores green until we migrate to the new 2.x FastMCP entry point in a follow-up. Root cause: `requirements.txt` had `mcp>=1.0.0` unbounded, so `pip install -r requirements.txt` in CI ignored the pyproject constraint. (#122)
- **FIX**: `_ensure_bm25_index` no longer traps the guard flag `_bm25_initialized` in a stuck-True state when the server boots against an empty ChromaDB collection. Prior behavior set the flag unconditionally at the end of the guarded block, so a fresh-install bootup or a metadata-mapping loss left BM25 permanently uninitialized: subsequent `add_document()` calls populate `bm25_index.corpus` but do not rebuild the inverted index, and `_ensure_bm25_index` — the only path that does — short-circuited on the stale flag. All keyword-only searches returned zero results; hybrid searches returned only semantic hits with `bm25_rank: null`. The flag is now set only after a build that actually produced an index; empty collections and exceptions leave it False so the next call retries. (#114)
- **TEST**: New `TestEmptyBootupDoesNotTrapGuardFlag` (5 tests) pins the contract — empty-collection boot leaves flag False, populated collection marks True, empty-then-populated recovery works, empty `get()` result leaves False, and `build_index()` exceptions leave False for retry. Baseline: 271 → 276.

### v4.5.0 (2026-07-06) — Hybrid Search Ranking & Routing Fix

- **FIX**: `search_knowledge` now searches the entire index when the user omits `category_filter`. The internal `_route_by_keywords()` heuristic previously acted as a hard where-filter on both the semantic and BM25 branches, so queries whose terms happened to map to a sparsely-populated category could return two documents while thousands of relevant chunks in other categories were silently dropped. The router is now **informational only**: the `routed_by` field is still populated in every result for telemetry (public API unchanged), but the candidate set is never restricted. Users who want a hard filter still get it by passing `category_filter=...` explicitly — which continues to filter BM25 consistently with #109. (#112)
- **NEW**: Hybrid search adds a small bounded ranking boost when query terms match indexed `source` or `filename` metadata, helping navigational queries surface the canonical file for a topic instead of adjacent files that only cross-reference it. The boost is capped at ~20% of typical RRF magnitudes, so it breaks near-ties without overriding semantic or BM25 signal. Public API unchanged. (#110, thanks @Hohlas)
- **TEST**: New `TestKeywordRoutingBehavior` (3 tests) pins the routing fix — BM25 and semantic branches must both see the full corpus when no explicit filter is passed, and explicit `category_filter` still overrides the router. New `TestPathAwareRanking` covers the path-metadata boost. Baseline: 266 → 271.
- **UPGRADE NOTE**: warm `query_cache` entries from before v4.5.0 should be invalidated by restarting the server so cached responses no longer reflect the pre-fix restrictive behavior.

### v4.4.0 (2026-07-06) — Cross-Platform Installer & Hybrid Search Category Filter

- **NEW**: Cross-platform, multi-LLM-client installer (`install.py`) driving both `install.sh` (Linux/macOS) and `install.ps1` (Windows) as thin wrappers. One codebase, one behavior across every OS.
- **NEW**: Auto-detects and registers `knowledge-rag` in 8 LLM clients — Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code (Copilot Chat), Cline, Gemini CLI, Zed — writing to each tool's canonical config path with the correct JSON schema per client (VS Code uses `servers`, Zed uses `context_servers`, everyone else uses `mcpServers`).
- **NEW**: `--for <clients>` / `--exclude <clients>` opt-in/opt-out selection, `--dry-run` preview, `--list-clients` registry inspection, `--pypi-version <ver>` pinning, `--skip-init` / `--skip-model` for fast reruns. See `python install.py --help`.
- **FIX**: `install.ps1` no longer writes MCP config to `~/.claude/mcp.json` (a stale secondary path); it now targets `~/.claude.json` — the file Claude Code actually reads — via idempotent JSON merge that preserves every existing MCP server entry with an automatic `.knowledge-rag.bak` backup.
- **FIX**: `install.ps1` gains PyPI mode (`pip install knowledge-rag`) and runs `mcp_server.server init` on install — feature parity with `install.sh`.
- **FIX**: MCP server spec no longer uses the fragile `cmd /c cd /d ... && python ...` wrapper on Windows; it emits the standard `command` + `cwd` shape supported natively by every modern client.
- **FIX**: `install.sh` guards against `sh install.sh` (bash-only features now emit a clear error instead of a cryptic syntax failure).
- **FIX**: Both scripts now correctly advertise **13 MCP tools** (was outdated at 12; `get_reindex_status` shipped in v4.3.0).
- **FIX**: Windows-side `install.ps1` prefers `winget install Python.Python.3.12 --scope user` (no admin), falls back to python.org 3.12.7 (was pinned to 3.12.0).
- **FIX**: Hybrid search now applies the active category filter to BM25 results before RRF fusion, preventing keyword-only BM25 hits from other categories from leaking into filtered searches. Both leak paths are closed: BM25 candidates are metadata-filtered before RRF (with `top_k` widened to `max_results * 20` to compensate for post-filter drop), and the fallback fetch during fusion re-checks `category` before adding a chunk to `combined_scores`. Note: the `category_filter` guard now also applies to the keyword-routed category — `_route_by_keywords()`-inferred routing filters BM25 too, consistent with the semantic branch. Users with warm `query_cache` entries should restart the server to invalidate stale results. (#109, thanks @Hohlas)
- **TEST**: New `tests/test_installer_no_data_loss.py` (22 tests) locks in the installer's zero-data-loss contract across all three JSON schemas (`mcpServers` / `servers` / `context_servers`): top-level keys preserved, sibling MCP servers byte-identical, `.knowledge-rag.bak` backup written before every mutation, idempotent second run, `--dry-run` writes nothing, atomic `os.replace` write. Baseline: 231 → 266.
- **TEST**: New `TestHybridCategoryFilter::test_bm25_results_respect_category_filter` in `tests/test_search.py` — deterministic regression covering BM25-only hits with mixed categories. Baseline: 266 → 267.

### v4.3.1 (2026-06-22) — Hybrid Search Fixes

- **FIX**: Accept `"general"` as a valid category in `search_knowledge`. The parser hardcodes `"general"` as the fallback in `_detect_category` (`ingestion.py`), but the validator only built `valid_categories` from `config.keyword_routes` + `config.category_mappings.values()` — so users who customized `config.yaml` and dropped the default `"general": "general"` mapping hit `Invalid category` even though the index contained `general` documents. Validator now always tolerates `"general"`. (#98, thanks @Hohlas)
- **FIX**: Skip BM25-only search results when Chroma can no longer resolve the chunk ID. Stale BM25 indices (typically right after `remove_document` or in the window between async reindex and BM25 rebuild) returned hits whose `collection.get()` came back empty; the previous fallback inserted entries with `document=""` / `metadata={}` into the reranker, polluting results with empty matches. The pipeline now `continue`s past those, dropping the stale hit cleanly. (#98, thanks @Hohlas)
- **TEST**: Added `tests/test_pr98_regression.py` (4 tests) pinning both contracts so future refactors cannot silently revert either fix. Test count baseline: 227 → 231. (#99)
- **CI**: Bumped `[tool.mypy] python_version` from 3.11 to 3.12 to accept PEP 695 `type` statements in the numpy stub (`numpy/__init__.pyi`) which were breaking the Pillar 7 strict gate. Only affects static analysis; `requires-python = ">=3.11"` unchanged. (#100)

### v4.3.0 (2026-06-17) — Async Reindex, GPU CUDA 12, 13th MCP Tool

- **NEW**: `get_reindex_status` MCP tool — lightweight reindex progress polling without computing full index stats. Returns active/idle status, percent, processed/total, errors, and last result.
- **NEW**: `reindex_documents` now runs in background via daemon thread — returns immediately with `{"status": "started"}`. Eliminates MCP timeout on large document sets (5K+ files). Concurrent calls return `already_running` with current progress.
- **NEW**: GPU acceleration with full CUDA 12 support — `onnxruntime-gpu` + 7 NVIDIA pip packages (`cublas`, `cudnn`, `cuda-runtime`, `cufft`, `cusparse`, `cusolver`, `curand`, `nvjitlink`). Server auto-detects GPU on startup with 4-step verification (providers, DLLs, nvidia-smi, session creation). Falls back to CPU gracefully.
- **NEW**: `_setup_cuda_dll_paths()` adds NVIDIA pip package DLL directories to `PATH` automatically on Windows — onnxruntime finds CUDA 12 DLLs without a full CUDA Toolkit install.
- **DEPS**: `[gpu]` extra expanded from 3 to 8 packages (added `cufft`, `cusparse`, `cusolver`, `curand`, `nvjitlink`).
- **FIX**: GPU status reporting now uses actual ONNX session creation test instead of just checking `get_available_providers()` — prevents false "GPU ACTIVE" when CUDA DLLs are missing.
- **DOCS**: GPU Acceleration section rewritten with complete requirements table, setup steps, verification instructions, and fallback behavior.
- **DOCS**: Tool reference updated — `reindex_documents` async behavior documented, `get_reindex_status` reference added.
- **TEST**: Backwards-compat baseline updated for 13 MCP tools.

### v4.2.0 (2026-06-17) — Search Performance & Output Quality

- **PERF**: Custom inverted-index BM25 replaces `rank-bm25` full-corpus scan — 128× faster keyword search on 50K+ chunk corpora. Only documents containing query terms are scored via posting lists.
- **PERF**: `numpy.argpartition` for O(n) top-k selection instead of O(n log n) sort.
- **PERF**: Batched adjacent chunk fetch — single ChromaDB `collection.get()` call replaces N round-trips per result.
- **PERF**: O(1) reverse lookup via `_source_to_docid` dict eliminates linear scans of `_indexed_docs` in `search_similar`, `update_document`, `remove_document`, and `_expand_with_adjacent_chunks`.
- **NEW**: `snippet_mode` parameter on `search_knowledge` (default: `true`) — truncates content to ~500 chars at natural break points with `content_length` field. Reduces token consumption by ~72%.
- **NEW**: `min_score` parameter on `search_knowledge` (default: `0.0`) — filters results below a normalized relevance threshold. Response includes `filtered_by_score` count.
- **NEW**: `filtered_by_score` field in search response JSON for transparency.
- **DEPS**: `numpy` added as direct dependency (was transitive via fastembed); `rank-bm25` import removed from server.py.
- **TEST**: 6 new tests for `min_score` filtering and `snippet_mode` truncation.
- **TEST**: Updated backwards-compat baseline to include new `search_knowledge` parameters.

### v4.1.2 (2026-06-17)

- **FIX**: `_save_metadata` dict snapshot prevents concurrent modification crash during file watcher events.
- **STYLE**: ruff format applied to server.py.

### v4.1.1 (2026-06-17)

- **FIX**: All `_indexed_docs` iterations now use `list()` snapshot, preventing `dictionary changed size during iteration` crash when FileWatcher modifies the index concurrently with MCP tool calls (affects `search_knowledge`, `search_similar`, `update_document`, `remove_document`, `evaluate_retrieval`, `list_categories`, `list_documents`)

### v4.1.0 (2026-06-17)

- **Added:** `query_expansion_groups` config for symmetric synonym expansion (#92)
- **Improved:** `expand_query()` now returns deterministic expansion order (set → ordered list with dedup)

### v4.0.1 (2026-06-16)

- **FIX**: Orphan cleanup now runs before indexing loop, preventing chunk loss when files are moved (#90).
- **FIX**: Chunk deduplication is now per-document instead of global, preventing cross-document chunk deletion (#91).
- **FIX**: Added `on_moved` handler to `DocumentWatcher` for proper file move detection.
- **FIX**: Startup preflight probes ChromaDB in a child process and moves crashing persistent indexes to `data/backups/auto-repair-*` before MCP initialization.
- **FIX**: Reranker load failures now fall back to RRF ordering instead of failing `search_knowledge` on offline machines.
- **FIX**: Virtualenv project-root detection now handles Python symlinks that resolve to the system interpreter.
- **NEW**: `knowledge-rag-guarded` console script kept as an explicit guarded startup alias.

### v4.0.0 (2026-06-09) — Enterprise Concurrent Access

- **NEW**: SSE and streamable-http transport modes — 1 server serves N clients (`server.transport: "sse"` in config.yaml or `--transport sse` CLI).
- **NEW**: Thread-safe shared state for concurrent queries — QueryCache locking, BM25 build lock, orchestrator double-checked locking.
- **NEW**: ChromaDB WAL mode enabled automatically in SSE/HTTP mode for concurrent read performance.
- **NEW**: Optional rate limiting — sliding-window counter, configurable RPM and burst, disabled by default.
- **NEW**: Optional Prometheus metrics endpoint — tool call counts, latency histograms, separate port, disabled by default.
- **NEW**: All 13 MCP tools instrumented with `@rate_limited` and `@instrument` decorators (zero-cost when disabled).
- **NEW**: `--transport` CLI override for Docker/systemd deployments.
- **NEW**: `pip install knowledge-rag[server]` optional dependency for SSE/HTTP (uvicorn).
- **CHANGED**: SSE/HTTP mode auto-enables single-instance lock (port collision prevention).
- **CHANGED**: `mcp` dependency bumped to `>=1.6.0` (SSE/streamable-http support).
- **MIGRATION**: Default transport remains `stdio` — existing users need zero changes. See config.example.yaml for SSE setup.

### v3.9.1 (2026-06-08)

- **FIX**: Expand `~` in `config.yaml` path values (`documents_dir`, `data_dir`, `models_cache_dir`) via `expanduser()` on all platforms (#86).
- **FIX**: Warn when `documents_dir` resolves to a non-existent path instead of silently indexing zero files.
- **FIX**: File watcher now uses accumulate-mode debounce — bulk file copies no longer starve the reindex trigger.
- **FIX**: Concurrent `index_all()` calls are serialized via `_index_lock` to prevent ChromaDB SQLite corruption.
- **FIX**: `collection.add()` is batched (500 chunks/call) to cap memory usage during large reindex operations.
- **NEW**: `KNOWLEDGE_RAG_WATCHER_DISABLED=1` env var to disable the file watcher for troubleshooting.
- **NEW**: Progress logging every 10% for reindex operations with >100 documents.

### v3.9.0 (2026-05-10) — Quality Gate

**Major governance + CI hardening release. No runtime behavior change in `mcp_server/`. Public API surface unchanged from v3.8.1.**

- **NEW** Quality Gate workflow (`.github/workflows/quality-gate.yml`) enforcing the 7 pillars on every PR: Security, Stability, Memory Leak, Versatility, Scalability, Versioning, Quality. 35+ status checks total.
- **NEW** Nightly resilience workflow (`.github/workflows/nightly.yml`): chaos suite (failure injection), 1h soak test (50K-iteration loop), determinism check (full suite × 3), mutation testing (mutmut). Auto-opens GitHub issue on any nightly failure.
- **NEW** Performance benchmark suite under `bench/` (12 microbenchmarks, pytest-benchmark) with 10% regression gate on every PR.
- **NEW** Public performance dashboard via GitHub Pages (`.github/workflows/bench-pages.yml`) — chart of latency/throughput per commit. Dormant until repo Pages is enabled.
- **NEW** Property-based fuzzing of all parsers via Hypothesis (`tests/test_ingestion_property.py`) — 200 random examples per CI run.
- **NEW** Memory baseline regression tests (`tests/test_memory_baseline.py`, cross-platform via psutil) — RSS bounded under 1000 queries; nightly soak amplifies to 50K iterations.
- **NEW** Property/locale/format/preset matrices (`tests/test_presets.py`, `tests/test_locale.py`, `tests/test_format_smoke.py`).
- **NEW** Backwards-compatibility regression tests (`tests/test_backwards_compat.py`) — legacy YAML configs from v3.6.0 / v3.7.0 still parse; all 13 MCP tool parameter names frozen.
- **NEW** AST-based public API surface diff (`scripts/check_api_surface.py`) — any breaking change blocks merge, baseline at `.github/api-surface-baseline.json`.
- **NEW** CHANGELOG enforcement (`scripts/check_changelog.py`) — user-facing PRs must add a bullet under `## Unreleased`; bypass via `skip-changelog` label.
- **NEW** Test count anti-regression (`scripts/check_test_count.py`) — guards against silent test deletion.
- **NEW** Conventional commits required on every PR title (commitlint via `amannn/action-semantic-pull-request`).
- **NEW** mypy `--strict` rolling out per-module (currently `instance_lock.py` + `preflight.py` + `scripts/`); interrogate docstring coverage ≥ 80%; radon, vulture, PR-size guard report-only.
- **NEW** CI matrix expanded to 9 cells: Linux + Windows + **macOS** × 3.11 + 3.12 + **3.13** (all required at v3.9.0; macOS / 3.13 promoted from experimental after two clean cycles).
- **NEW** Governance docs: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, 3 issue templates, expanded `CODEOWNERS`.
- **NEW** Pre-commit hooks: ruff, gitleaks, version-sync, conventional commits.
- **CHORE** `.github/codecov.yml` enforcing coverage trend gate (-0.5pp blocks; new code ≥ 70%).

### v3.8.1 (2026-05-10) — hotfix

- **FIX (critical)**: `FastEmbedEmbeddings.__call__` no longer returns vectors of zeros when the ONNX model fails to load or `embed()` raises. The previous behavior silently corrupted the index — ChromaDB stored zero embeddings, `count()` reported normal numbers, smart-reindex skipped the bad chunks, and queries returned garbage scores with no error visible. Now raises `EmbeddingModelLoadError` / `EmbeddingError`. (#36)
- **FIX**: Sticky `_load_failed` flag — after a load failure, subsequent calls re-raise immediately instead of looping through HuggingFace download attempts (was the "frozen query" UX in v3.8.0).
- **NEW**: Sanity checks in `__call__` — embed count and dim mismatches raise `EmbeddingError` instead of silently returning malformed vectors.
- **TEST**: 7 new regression cases in `tests/test_lazy_embeddings.py`, including `test_does_not_return_zero_vectors_silently` as a guard for the whole class of bug.
- **NOTE**: This is a pre-existing bug in master, not introduced by v3.8.0. v3.8.0 lazy-load expanded the impact (failures moved to query time). All v3.8.0 users should upgrade.

### v3.8.0 (2026-05-10)

- **NEW**: Lazy-load FastEmbed embedding model (~200MB ONNX runtime). Loads on first query instead of startup — idle `knowledge-rag` processes are now cheap, which matters when MCP stdio clients spawn parallel server processes (multiple Claude Code windows, Claude Desktop + IDE, etc.). Public API unchanged. (#32)
- **NEW**: Opt-in single-instance guard via `KNOWLEDGE_RAG_SINGLE_INSTANCE=1` env var. **OFF by default** — multi-client MCP usage continues to work unchanged. When enabled, a second server process for the same `data_dir` exits with code 75 (`EX_TEMPFAIL`). Includes stale-PID recovery and SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers. See [docs/single-instance.md](docs/single-instance.md). (#33, original concept by @Hohlas in #31)
- **NEW**: `examples/mcp-config-single-instance.json` — sample MCP client config for the opt-in guard.
- **DOCS**: New `docs/single-instance.md` — when to use, when NOT to use, troubleshooting, full activation reference.
- **DOCS**: README troubleshooting section for "Multiple MCP clients spawn duplicate servers" + memory-usage note for lazy embeddings.
- **CHORE**: Sync version across `pyproject.toml`, `mcp_server/__init__.py`, and `npm/package.json` (was drifting since v3.5.x).
- **CHORE**: pytest `tmp_path_retention_count=1` to avoid Windows atexit cleanup race in CI.
- **ROADMAP**: Tracked v4.0 shared-service architecture (one daemon, many thin MCP clients) as the long-term fix for multi-process resource duplication. (#34)

### v3.6.2 (2026-04-23)

- **INFRA**: NPM provenance attestation (SLSA supply chain security), full README on npm page
- **DOCS**: Reorganize Installation section — add NPX and Docker install methods, update What's New to v3.6.0

### v3.6.0 (2026-04-23)

- **NEW**: Multi-language code parsing — C (`.c`), C++ (`.cpp`/`.h`), JavaScript (`.js`/`.jsx`), TypeScript (`.ts`/`.tsx`) with per-language function/class/import extraction
- **NEW**: XML parser (`.xml`) — root element and namespace metadata extraction
- **NEW**: All 8 new formats default enabled — no config change needed
- **NEW**: NPM wrapper (`npx knowledge-rag`) + Docker image (`ghcr.io/lyonzin/knowledge-rag`)
- **NEW**: Automated release pipeline — PyPI (Trusted Publishing), NPM, Docker GHCR
- **IMPROVED**: Code parser reports correct `language` metadata per file type (was hardcoded to `"python"` for all code files)

### v3.5.2 (2026-04-16)

- **NEW**: Auto-discovery of CUDA 12 DLLs from pip-installed NVIDIA packages — no manual PATH configuration needed
- **NEW**: Graceful GPU→CPU fallback with `[WARN]` log when CUDA init fails (missing drivers, wrong version, etc.)
- **FIX**: Explicit `CPUExecutionProvider` when `gpu: false` — eliminates noisy CUDA probe errors in logs
- **FIX**: BASE_DIR resolution now correctly prefers directories with `config.yaml` over those with only `config.example.yaml` (fixes editable installs)

### v3.5.1 (2026-04-16)

- **FIX**: Removed Python upper bound constraint (`<3.13` → `>=3.11`). Python 3.13 and 3.14 now supported — onnxruntime ships wheels for both.

### v3.5.0 (2026-04-16)

- **NEW**: Optional GPU acceleration for ONNX embeddings — `pip install knowledge-rag[gpu]` + `models.embedding.gpu: true` in config. 5-10x faster indexing on NVIDIA GPUs with automatic CPU fallback.
- **DOCS**: Supported formats table added to README (20 formats)

### v3.4.3 (2026-04-16)

- **FIX**: Correct stdout protection via save/restore pattern — `__init__.py` saves original stdout and redirects to stderr during init, `server.py main()` restores it before `mcp.run()`. v3.4.2's global redirect broke MCP JSON-RPC response channel.

### v3.4.1 (2026-04-16)

- **FIX**: `pip install knowledge-rag` now auto-detects project directory from venv location
- **NEW**: `install.sh` — Linux/macOS installer with pip and from-source modes
- **IMPROVED**: BASE_DIR resolution chain: env var → source dir → venv parent → CWD → fallback

### v3.4.0 (2026-04-16)

- **NEW**: `models_cache_dir` — persistent embedding model cache, prevents re-download after reboots
- **NEW**: `exclude_patterns` — glob-based file/directory exclusion during indexing
- **NEW**: Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) parser — extracts markdown and code cell sources only
- **NEW**: MCP stdout protection — redirects stdout to stderr before server start
- **NEW**: File watcher resilience — graceful fallback when Linux inotify limits are reached
- **NEW**: MetaTrader (.mq4, .mqh) support — opt-in code parsing
- **NEW**: 23 new tests (exclude patterns, ipynb parser, stdout protection)
- Community credit: [@Hohlas](https://github.com/Hohlas) ([PR #18](https://github.com/lyonzin/knowledge-rag/pull/18))
