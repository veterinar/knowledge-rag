### Python version mismatch

Requires Python 3.11 or newer.

```bash
python --version    # Must be 3.11+
```

### FastEmbed model download fails

On first run, FastEmbed downloads models to `models_cache/`. If the download fails:

```bash
# Clear cache and retry
# Windows:
rmdir /s /q models_cache

# Linux/macOS:
rm -rf models_cache

# Then restart the MCP server
```

### Reranker model download fails

The reranker is lazy-loaded on the first query. If the model is not cached and the machine is offline, search continues without reranking and uses the RRF order from hybrid retrieval. To keep reranking enabled offline, run one query while online or pre-populate `models_cache/` on the target machine.

You can still disable reranking explicitly in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
models:
  reranker:
    enabled: false
```

Disabling reranking reduces memory use and avoids first-query model loading. The tradeoff is lower ranking precision, especially when several chunks match the same terms but only one is the best answer.

### ChromaDB index crashes on startup

Native ChromaDB failures can terminate Python before normal exception handling runs. Startup now probes ChromaDB in a child process before initializing the MCP server. If the probe crashes, the active `chroma_db/` and `index_metadata.json` are moved to `data/backups/auto-repair-*`, and the next startup can rebuild a clean index.

The same guarded behavior is available through either console script:

```bash
knowledge-rag
knowledge-rag-guarded
```

### Index is empty

```bash
# Check documents directory has files
ls documents/

# Force reindex via Claude Code:
# reindex_documents(force=True)

# Or nuclear rebuild if model changed:
# reindex_documents(full_rebuild=True)
```

### MCP server not loading

1. Check `~/.claude.json` exists and has valid JSON in the `mcpServers` section
2. Verify paths use double backslashes (`\\`) on Windows
3. Restart Claude Code completely
4. Run `claude mcp list` to check connection status

### "Failed to connect" error

The MCP server uses stdout for JSON-RPC communication. If a library prints to stdout during init, the stream gets corrupted. v3.4.3+ includes stdout protection that prevents this. If you're on an older version, upgrade:

```bash
pip install --upgrade knowledge-rag
```

### Slow first query

The cross-encoder reranker model is lazy-loaded on the first query. This adds a one-time ~2-3 second delay for model download and loading. Subsequent queries are fast. If the model cannot be loaded, search falls back to RRF ordering and does not retry loading the reranker until the server restarts.

### Memory usage

With ~200 documents, expect ~300-500MB RAM. The embedding model (~200MB ONNX runtime resident, lazy-loaded on first query since v3.8.0) and reranker (~25MB, lazy-loaded) are loaded into memory only when actually used. For very large knowledge bases (1000+ documents), consider enabling GPU acceleration and using exclude patterns to limit index scope.

### Multiple MCP clients spawn duplicate servers

MCP stdio is one process per client by protocol — multiple Claude Code windows, Claude Desktop + IDE, etc. each spawn their own `knowledge-rag` process. Since v3.8.0 idle processes are cheap (no embedding model loaded until first query). If you've measured and want a hard cap of one server per data directory, opt in:

```bash
export KNOWLEDGE_RAG_SINGLE_INSTANCE=1
```

A second instance exits immediately with code 75. Default is OFF (multi-client friendly). Full guide: [docs/single-instance.md](docs/single-instance.md). Sample MCP config: [examples/mcp-config-single-instance.json](examples/mcp-config-single-instance.json).

### SSE server won't start

```bash
# Check if port 8179 is already in use
# Windows:
netstat -aon | findstr :8179
# Linux/macOS:
lsof -i :8179
```

If `uvicorn` is not found, install the server extras: `pip install knowledge-rag[server]`

### Can't connect to SSE server

Verify the server is running and the URL is correct:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8179/sse
```

Common issues:
- Wrong URL: must end with `/sse` (not just the port)
- Firewall blocking the port
- Server started with a different host/port than configured in the MCP client

### Versioned build fails with exit 14 (sidecar sweep) right after a green population

Known flake (observed 2026-08-27, macOS, chromadb pinned by the generation
lockfile): the isolated child population finishes green, but the sqlite
WAL/SHM sidecar files under the child's chroma directory survive the close —
the finalizer is flaky, not deterministic — and the post-population sidecar
sweep correctly refuses to seal (exit 14).

This is the guard working, not the guard broken: a generation must be sealed
from quiescent bytes only. Re-run the build; the second attempt has come back
clean. Do not weaken or skip the sweep to "fix" this, and do not delete the
sidecars by hand inside a candidate generation — a hand-mutated candidate is
a new candidate.
